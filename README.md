# CPR
My first app for Android that I created by myself. It is for those with no CPR training to reference in case they are presented with a situation that may involve the person doing CPR on a victim.
All information presented is from http://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-cpr/basics/art-20056600 and http://heart.arizona.edu/frequently-asked-questions.
The app allows the user to dial 911 with the push of one button (but does not automatically call emergency services). It also plays the song "Staying Alive," which has a tempo of 100 BPM, the recommended speed to perform chest compressions.
